## What is Cloud Computing?

### What is Cloud Computing? 

Cloud computing is a technology that enables users to access and use a variety of computing resources, such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more, over the internet.

Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware and software, individuals and organizations can leverage cloud services provided by third-party cloud service providers.

### Quick history/timeline of Cloud Computing.

- Started in the 1960s with the early internet.
- Web-based business apps emerged in the 1990s.
- In 2006, Amazon pioneered modern cloud services.
- Microsoft and Google joined in the 2010s, making cloud computing widespread.

### What can you do with Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing enables a wide range of applications, including:

- **Hosting**: You can host websites, web applications, and databases in the cloud.

- **Storage and Backup**: Cloud storage solutions allow you to store and back up data securely.

- **Big Data and Analytics**: Cloud platforms provide tools for processing and analyzing large datasets.

- **Machine Learning and AI**: Cloud services offer powerful machine learning and artificial intelligence tools and frameworks.

- **IoT Applications**: The cloud is essential for managing and analyzing data from Internet of Things devices.

- **Development and Testing**: Developers can create and test applications in cloud environments.

### What are the 4 TYPES of Cloud?

There are four primary types of cloud deployment models:

- **Public Cloud**

- **Private Cloud**

- **Hybrid Cloud**

- **Multi-Cloud**

### What are the different types of cloud SERVICE?

Cloud services are categorized into three main service models:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including virtual machines, storage, and networking.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without worrying about infrastructure details.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for installation and maintenance.

### Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud? Specifically for a business.

Advantages:

- **Cost Savings**: Cloud services can reduce capital expenses (CapEx) and provide a pay-as-you-go model, reducing overall IT costs.

- **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.

- **Flexibility**: Access resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

- **Disaster Recovery**: Cloud providers offer robust backup and recovery solutions.

- **Automatic Updates**: Cloud providers manage infrastructure updates, reducing maintenance efforts.

Disadvantages:

- **Security Concerns**: Businesses must ensure data security and compliance with regulations.

- **Downtime**: Cloud outages can disrupt business operations.

- **Limited Customization**: Some cloud services may have limitations on customization.

### What is OpEx vs CapEx?

**OpEx (Operational Expenditure)**: Ongoing costs incurred to run a business, such as cloud subscription fees, are considered operational expenses.

**CapEx (Capital Expenditure):** One-time investments in physical assets like servers or data centers are considered capital expenditures.

### Marketshare - What is the breakdown?

The cloud market is dominated by several major providers:

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Other cloud providers** make up the remainder of the market share.

### What are the 3 largest Cloud providers known for (What makes them popular?)

**1. AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Known for its extensive service offerings, reliability, and market leadership.

**2. Azure (Microsoft Azure):** Strong integration with Microsoft products and services, making it popular among enterprises.

**3. GCP (Google Cloud Platform):** Emphasizes data analytics, machine learning, and innovation, appealing to businesses in those domains.

### What are the 4 pillars of DevOps? How do they link into the Cloud do you think?

The four pillars of DevOps are:

**Culture:** Encourages collaboration between development and operations teams, which can be facilitated by cloud services that provide shared, scalable resources.

**Automation:** Cloud platforms offer automation tools that streamline deployment, scaling, and management of applications and infrastructure.

**Measurement:** Cloud environments provide extensive monitoring and analytics capabilities, helping teams measure and improve performance.

**Sharing:** Cloud-based collaboration tools and platforms enable sharing of information, code, and best practices among DevOps teams, promoting knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.
